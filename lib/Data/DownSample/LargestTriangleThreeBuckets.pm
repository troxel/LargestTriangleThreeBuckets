=head1 NAME

Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets - Downsample data for efficient plotting of data

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.00

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements a downsample technique known as Largest Triangle Three Buckets as defined 
in Sveinn Steinarsson MS thesis. 

http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15343/37285/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf

The idea is to downsample a data set without losing the visual 
character of the plotted data.  The technique draws on ideas in cartographic 
generalization or polyline simplification.  This technique is often useful in 
client-server applications such as webserver-browser where the length of the data far exceeds the pixels available to 
plot. Reducing the data size significantly speeds up data transfer and rendering time.

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
  use Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets;

  my $lttb = new Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets( {threshold=>1000} );

  my $data_src = [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], ... ]; # <-- load your data source as a reference to a list of a lists

  my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src);
        
     
=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 lttb()


  my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src);

Also can overwrite the class threshold variable such as 

  my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src,20000);

This function is an optimized version of the algorithm given in Sveinn Steinarsson paper.  
Several of the math operation are factored out of the loops and executes about 
33% faster. 

=head2 lttb_ref()


  my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb_ref($data_src);

The reference function implimentation of the algorithm given in 
Sveinn Steinarsson paper and used to verify that the optimized version 
is giving correct results.
